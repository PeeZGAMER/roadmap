# Number Guessing Game

## First assignment
Welcome to my first roadmap.sh C project. This is a simple number guessing CLI game where the computer picks a random number, and the user has to guess it.

## How to run the game:
1. Clone the git repository
2. Open the terminal and 
3. Compile the program using a C compiler like GCC:
```sh
gcc -o guessr ./guessr.c
```
4. Run the program:
```sh
./guessr
```
5. Follow the game instructions and enjoy!

## Notes
This is my first project on GitHub.
So if you find any bugs, feel free to let me know (or pretend they don't exist :p).
While creating this project I forgot to press 'Start project', so I hadn't created a repo for this project beforehand ðŸ˜…. Initial commit is completed program. Won't happen in the future (i hope).
